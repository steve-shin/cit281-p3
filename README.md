## Welcome to Project 3

### Learning Objectives

#### After completing this project, you will:

- Gain experience interpreting functional descriptions and specifications to complete an assignment
- Gain experience breaking a project into manageable components
- Gain experience writing and executing non-web server Node.js JavaScript code using VSCode
- Practice creating and using code modules
- Practice refactoring using modern JavaScript syntax
- Gain experience writing and executing web server Node.js JavaScript code using VSCode
- Gain experience using Fastify with the GET verb, routes, and query parameters
- Gain experience loading a file and using as a web page

### Overview

- You will be creating a "coinage" code module that is capable of calculating the total value of coin objects. After completing the "coinage" code module functionality, you will then update the "server" code file as a true Node.js web server using the Fastify package. The updated "server" file will display an initial web page with web links to to test the "coinage" code. The initial web page will be loaded from a file.
